# National Park Trails Capstone Project
This project is focused around understanding national park trail data (U.S.), specifically what trail statistics, features, and activities have the strongest and weakest effects on the trailâ€™s popularity, rating, and usage. The purpose is to help learn how and where future trails can best be designed to create the most interest. The process of trail-making is a long and difficult one so having a better idea of what the demand is like may help National Park Services improve interest in current and future trail systems. The final product is a machine learning classifier that can predict trail ratings with a 90% accuracy based off of the trail's features and activities

You can follow the process of importing the raw data in Jupyter Notebooks through cleaning, wrangling, exploration, statistical analysis, and finally the machine learning prediction models [here](https://github.com/evamintz/National-Parks-Capstone-Project/blob/master/NPT%20Jupyter%20Notebook.ipynb).

In a [slideshow presentation](https://github.com/evamintz/National-Parks-Capstone-Project/blob/master/National%20Park%20Trails%20Slides.pdf) - main points/conclusions, shortest and easiest to follow along with.

In a [written report](https://github.com/evamintz/National-Parks-Capstone-Project/blob/master/NPT%20Report%20(2).pdf) - ~10 pages with graphs and in depth discussion of analysis.
